To build a website without such knowledge, one option is to use an online webpage builder such as Wix and WordPress. Such online builders are easy to use, but there are deficiencies:\n You usually need to pay monthly to get rid of the logo or ads provided by the builder. You may have to pay more to use a customized domain, such as your-name.com. It is hard to insert code snippets or formulas. Just imagine doing that in Word. It is hard to add the function you want.  To avoid payment and save time, I switched to another option: Blogdown, recently developed by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill. The advantages of Blogdown, especially for R users, are obvious:\n Everything is done in Rstudio. Free. You can write your blog or post through Rmarkdown, which is compatible to R programming and math environment. You pay a small amount of money to use a customized domain. (I paid $7.99/year for using bingkaiwang.com.) With GitHub, once you push a change, it will show on the webpage immediately.  In this article, I will give an overview on how to construct a website using Blogdown. A detailed and well-written tutorial of Blogdown can be found here.\n1 Build your website using Blogdown 1.1 Prerequistes To use the R package Blogdown, here is some knowledge you need to know:\n basic Rstudio programming, R markdown, (recommended) GitHub.  If you are familiar with all of above, then you are ready to start!\n 1.2 Steps to build a website Open Rstudio and install required packages by install.packages(\u0026quot;blogdown\u0026quot;) and blogdown::install_hugo().\n Make sure your Rstudio version is at least v1.1.383. Then create a website project from the menu File -\u0026gt; New Project -\u0026gt; New Directory. In the next step, select Website using blogdown. In the next step, choose the directory, give a directory name and click “Create Project”. (Notice that the default theme is “hugo-lithium”.How to use others themes is introduced in the next section.)  Once you create your project, you will find a bunch of files and folders in this directory. Don’t worry, since you will only care about the following three:\n   config.toml, which contains the global option of the current website. content, which stores all your materials, such as your CV and posts. static, which usually stores images and videos.\nFollow the instructions given by the theme to change options in config.toml and add content in the sub-folder of content. For example, you can create an Rmarkdown file in content/post and save it when you finish. Different themes have different structures and formats. You need to figure out yourself where to add posts and the meaning of parameters.  Use the command blogdown:::serve_site() to run your project. You will see the website in the “Viewer” window. You only need to run this command once and all changes after that will be automatically synchronized.   1.3 Change the theme A theme, or called “Hugo theme”, is basically a template for building a website. Given a theme, what’s left is just adding your materials. Aside from the default theme, there are a lot of themes available here for different purposes.\nTo use a different theme, you need to find the GitHub repository for that theme and specify it when creating the website project. For example, I used the “Academic Theme”, whose GitHub repo is gcushen/hugo-academic. In the GitHub repo page, a documentation file is usually given. Not all of those themes have the function you desire. In this case, just go for another one and read the documentation.\n  2 Publish your website Once you finish building the website locally, it’s time to publish it.\n First connect this R project to a GitHub repository. (See here for how to do this.) Go to Netlify, which is a website for deploying your website. Login with you GitHub account and click “New site from Git”. Follow the instructions to deploy.  Notice that in the last step, please make sure that the HUGO_VERSION parameter has the correct value, which means you need to use the Hugo version described in the theme documentation. (The Academic theme requires version 0.42.)\n It takes a few minutes to deploy. Once finished, you will get a domain like *.netfily.com, where * is a random string. By visiting this address on a web browser, you will be able to see you website.\nThe benefit of connecting your website to you GitHub account is that, once you push a change, Netlify will catch that change in your GitHub repo and update your website automatically. This means you don’t need to deploy your website every time you make a change.\nI only used Netlify for deployment, but there are also other tools available. Personally I think it’s simple and fast with Netlify.\n 3 Customize your domain Having a website with random domain is not satisfying. It would be great if the personal website has domain yourname.com. For doing this, I bought such a domain on namecheap. It cost me $7.99 per year. (There are also others available.)\nThen you connect your website with this domain. In your Netlify homepage, click “Domains” on the Navigation bar and the click “Add or register domain”.\n Following the instructions, you will be provided some DNS, which is used to link you website and you domain. Then go back to namecheap, enter “Domain List” and click the “manage” button of your domain. Then in the “Nameserver” panel, type the DNS you got from Netlify and save the change.\n Check an hour later by using the new domain, and you will see your website!\n 4 Resources and tools I learned most of the knowledge from the following webpages:\n blogdown: Creating Websites with R Markdown by Yihui Xie and Amber Thomas Making a Website Using blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages also by Amber Thomas Getting Started with blogdown by M. Edward (Ed) Borasky  I also find some tools that are helpful to maintain a website;\n Google Analytics, which is used to track visits to your website.

The baseline variables could include, e.g., age, sex, disease severity, and biomarkers. According to two surveys of clinical trial reports, there is confusion about the statistical properties of covariate adjustment. We focus on the ANCOVA estimator, which involves fitting a linear model for the outcome given the treatment arm and baseline variables. We prove the following new (to the best of our knowledge) robustness property of ANCOVA to arbitrary model misspecification: Not only is the ANCOVA point estimate consistent (as proved by Yang and Tsiatis (2001)) but so is its standard error. This implies that confidence intervals and hypothesis tests conducted as if the linear model were correct are still valid even when the linear model is arbitrarily misspecified, e.g., when the baseline variables are nonlinearly related to the outcome or there is treatment effect heterogeneity. We also give a simple, robust formula for the variance reduction (equivalently, sample size reduction) from using ANCOVA. By re-analyzing completed randomized trials for mild cognitive impairment, schizophrenia, and depression, we demonstrate how ANCOVA can reduce variance, reduce bias conditional on chance imbalance, and increase power even when by chance there is perfect balance across arms in the baseline variables.","tags":[],"title":"Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) in Randomized Trials","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paniz Charkhchi","*Bingkai Wang*","Brian Caffo","David Yousem"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516161600,"objectID":"eadd52a0695e3434779126e0c7aadfb0","permalink":"/publication/ajnr/","publishdate":"2018-01-17T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/ajnr/","section":"publication","summary":"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The validity of radiology peer review requires an unbiased assessment of studies in an environment that values the process. We assessed radiologists' behavior reviewing colleagues' reports. We hypothesized that when a radiologist receives a discrepant peer review, he is more likely to submit a discrepant review about another radiologist. \n\n CONCLUSIONS: The receipt of a clinically not significant discrepant report leads to a greater likelihood of submitting a discrepant report. The motivation for such an increase should be explored for potential bias.","tags":[],"title":"Bias in Neuroradiology Peer Review: Impact of a “Ding” on “Dinging” Others","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi Zhao","*Bingkai Wang*","Stewart Mostofsky","Brian Caffo","Xi Luo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1516161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516161600,"objectID":"c86bae110de93c8113e98129415b01ab","permalink":"/publication/cov-reg/","publishdate":"2018-01-17T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/cov-reg/","section":"publication","summary":"Modeling variances in data has been an important topic in many fields, including in financial and neuroimaging analysis. We consider the problem of regressing covariance matrices on a vector covariates, collected from each observational unit. The main aim is to uncover the variation in the covariance matrices across units that are explained by the covariates. This paper introduces Covariate Assisted Principal (CAP) regression, an optimization-based method for identifying the components predicted by (generalized) linear models of the covariates. We develop computationally efficient algorithms to jointly search the projection directions and regression coefficients, and we establish the asymptotic properties. Using extensive simulation studies, our method shows higher accuracy and robustness in coefficient estimation than competing methods. Applied to a resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging study, our approach identifies the human brain network changes associated with age and sex.","tags":[],"title":"Covariate Assisted Principal Regression for Covariance Matrix Outcomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" Click on the Slides button above to view the built-in slides feature.\n  Slides can be added in a few ways:\n Create slides using Academic\u0026rsquo;s Slides feature and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Upload an existing slide deck to static/ and link using url_slides parameter in the front matter of the talk file Embed your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using shortcodes.
