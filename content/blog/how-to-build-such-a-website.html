<p>As a statistician, learning the basics of website construction is painful and time-consuming. To build a website without such knowledge, one option is to use an online webpage builder such as <a href="https://www.wix.com/">Wix</a> and <a href="www.wordpress.com/">WordPress</a>. Such online builders are easy to use, but there are deficiencies:</p>
<ul>
<li>You usually need to pay monthly to get rid of the logo or ads provided by the builder.</li>
<li>You may have to pay more to use a customized domain, such as <code>your-name.com</code>.</li>
<li>It is hard to insert code snippets or formulas. Just imagine doing that in Word.</li>
<li>It is hard to add the function you want.</li>
</ul>
<p>To avoid payment and save time, I switched to another option: <code>Blogdown</code>, recently developed by Yihui Xie, Amber Thomas, Alison Presmanes Hill. The advantages of <code>Blogdown</code>, especially for R users, are obvious:</p>
<ul>
<li>Everything is done in Rstudio.</li>
<li>Free.</li>
<li>You can write your blog or post through <code>Rmarkdown</code>, which is compatible to R programming and math environment.</li>
<li>You pay a small amount of money to use a customized domain. (I paid $7.99/year for using <code>bingkaiwang.com</code>.)</li>
<li>With GitHub, once you push a change, it will show on the webpage immediately.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this article, I will give an overview on how to construct a website using <code>Blogdown</code>. A detailed and well-written tutorial of <code>Blogdown</code> can be found <a href="https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/">here</a>.</p>
<div id="build-your-website-using-blogdown" class="section level1" number="1">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Build your website using Blogdown</h1>
<div id="prerequistes" class="section level2" number="1.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> Prerequistes</h2>
<p>To use the R package <code>Blogdown</code>, here is some knowledge you need to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>basic Rstudio programming,</li>
<li>R markdown,</li>
<li>(recommended) GitHub.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are familiar with all of above, then you are ready to start!</p>
</div>
<div id="steps-to-build-a-website" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> Steps to build a website</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Open Rstudio and install required packages by <code>install.packages("blogdown")</code> and <code>blogdown::install_hugo()</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure your Rstudio version is at least v1.1.383. Then create a website project from the menu <code>File -&gt; New Project -&gt; New Directory</code>. In the next step, select <code>Website using blogdown</code>. In the next step, choose the directory, give a directory name and click “Create Project”. (Notice that the default theme is “hugo-lithium”.How to use others themes is introduced in the next section.)

<li><p>Once you create your project, you will find a bunch of files and folders in this directory. Don’t worry, since you will only care about the following three:</p></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>config.toml</code>, which contains the global option of the current website.</li>
<li><code>content</code>, which stores all your materials, such as your CV and posts.</li>
<li><code>static</code>, which usually stores images and videos.<br />
Follow the instructions given by the theme to change options in <code>config.toml</code> and add content in the sub-folder of <code>content</code>. For example, you can create an Rmarkdown file in <code>content/post</code> and save it when you finish. Different themes have different structures and formats. You need to figure out yourself where to add posts and the meaning of parameters.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Use the command <code>blogdown:::serve_site()</code> to run your project. You will see the website in the “Viewer” window. You only need to run this command once and all changes after that will be automatically synchronized.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="change-the-theme" class="section level2" number="1.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> Change the theme</h2>
<p>A theme, or called “Hugo theme”, is basically a template for building a website. Given a theme, what’s left is just adding your materials. Aside from the default theme, there are a lot of themes available <a href="http://themes.gohugo.io">here</a> for different purposes.</p>
<p>To use a different theme, you need to find the GitHub repository for that theme and specify it when creating the website project. For example, I used the “Academic Theme”, whose GitHub repo is <code>gcushen/hugo-academic</code>. In the GitHub repo page, a documentation file is usually given. Not all of those themes have the function you desire. In this case, just go for another one and read the documentation.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="publish-your-website" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> Publish your website</h1>
<p>Once you finish building the website locally, it’s time to publish it.</p>
<ul>
<li>First connect this R project to a GitHub repository. (See <a href="https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-GitHub.html">here</a> for how to do this.)</li>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, which is a website for deploying your website. Login with you GitHub account and click “New site from Git”. Follow the instructions to deploy.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/img/blog-img/how-to-build-such-a-website/sec3-1.png" />
Notice that in the last step, please make sure that the <code>HUGO_VERSION</code> parameter has the correct value, which means you need to use the Hugo version described in the theme documentation. (The Academic theme requires version 0.42.)</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog-img/how-to-build-such-a-website/sec3-2.png" /></p>
<p>It takes a few minutes to deploy. Once finished, you will get a domain like <code>*.netfily.com</code>, where <code>*</code> is a random string. By visiting this address on a web browser, you will be able to see you website.</p>
<p>The benefit of connecting your website to you GitHub account is that, once you push a change, Netlify will catch that change in your GitHub repo and update your website automatically. This means you don’t need to deploy your website every time you make a change.</p>
<p>I only used Netlify for deployment, but there are also other tools available. Personally I think it’s simple and fast with Netlify.</p>
</div>
<div id="customize-your-domain" class="section level1" number="3">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">3</span> Customize your domain</h1>
<p>Having a website with random domain is not satisfying. It would be great if the personal website has domain <code>yourname.com.</code> For doing this, I bought such a domain on <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>. It cost me $7.99 per year. (There are also others available.)</p>
<p>Then you connect your website with this domain. In your Netlify homepage, click “Domains” on the Navigation bar and the click “Add or register domain”.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog-img/how-to-build-such-a-website/sec3-3.png" /></p>
<p>Following the instructions, you will be provided some DNS, which is used to link you website and you domain. Then go back to <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">namecheap</a>, enter “Domain List” and click the “manage” button of your domain. Then in the “Nameserver” panel, type the DNS you got from Netlify and save the change.</p>
<p><img src="/img/blog-img/how-to-build-such-a-website/sec3-4.png" /></p>
<p>Check an hour later by using the new domain, and you will see your website!</p>
