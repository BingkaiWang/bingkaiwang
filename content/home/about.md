## Biography

I am a tenure-track assistant professor in the Department of Biostatistics, School of Public Health, University of Michigan. My research interests are in causal inference, randomized clinical trials, clustered data and their interactions with infectious disease research. 

I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Statistics and Data Science Department of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania (advised by [Dylan Small](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/) and [Nicholas P. Jewell](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/nicholas-p-jewell)). I got my PhD degree from the Biostatistics department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (advised by [Michael Rosenblum](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2241/michael-a-rosenblum) and [Brian Caffo](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1010/brian-s-caffo)).

My CV is available [here](files/CV.pdf).

__I am looking for dedicated PhD students/postdocs!__

__[News]__ I am fortunate to receive the 2024 IMS New Researcher Travel Award.

__[News]__ My work "Model-robust and efficient inference for cluster-randomized experiments” has been accepted by Journal of American Statistical Association: Theory and Methods.

__[News]__ My work "Model-Robust Inference for Clinical Trials that Improve Precision by Stratified Randomization and Adjustment for Covariate Adjustment" has been cited by the FDA in their 2023 Guidance for Industry: [“Adjusting for Covariates in Randomized Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics.”](https://www.fda.gov/media/148910/download) 

__[News]__ My K99/R00 application was scored 10 (the best score) in the peer-review phase at NIAID! (My experience is shared in my blog [here](/blog/k99/).) I have started my K99 phase on May 1st, 2023 and my R00 on May 1st, 2024.
