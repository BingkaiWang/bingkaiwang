## Biography

I am a postdoctoral fellow in the Statistics and Data Science Department of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania (advised by [Dylan Small](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/) and [Nicholas P. Jewell](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/nicholas-p-jewell)).

I got my PhD degree from the Biostatistics department in Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (advised by [Michael Rosenblum](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2241/michael-a-rosenblum) and [Brian Caffo](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1010/brian-s-caffo)).

My research interests are in causal inference, randomized clinical trials, and precision medicine. 

My CV is available [[here](files/CV.pdf)].
