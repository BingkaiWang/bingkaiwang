## Biography

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Statistics and Data Science Department of the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania (advised by [Dylan Small](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/dsmall/) and [Nicholas P. Jewell](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/people/nicholas-p-jewell)).

I got my PhD degree from the Biostatistics department at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health (advised by [Michael Rosenblum](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/2241/michael-a-rosenblum) and [Brian Caffo](https://www.jhsph.edu/faculty/directory/profile/1010/brian-s-caffo)).

My research interests are in causal inference, randomized clinical trials, clustered data and their interactions with infectious disease research and computer sciences. 

My CV is available [here](files/CV.pdf).

__[News]__ My work "“Model-robust and efficient inference for cluster-randomized experiments” has been accepted by Journal of American Statistical Association: Theory and Methods.

__[News]__ My work "Model-Robust Inference for Clinical Trials that Improve Precision by Stratified Randomization and Adjustment for Covariate Adjustment" has been cited by the FDA in their 2023 Guidance for Industry: [“Adjusting for Covariates in Randomized Clinical Trials for Drugs and Biologics.”](https://www.fda.gov/media/148910/download) 

__[News]__ My K99/R00 application was scored 10 (the best score) in the peer-review phase at NIAID! (My experience is shared in my blog [here](/blog/k99/).) I have started my K99 phase on May 1st, 2023.

__[News]__ I will join the [Biostatistics department at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://sph.umich.edu/biostat/) as a tenure-track assistant professor in 2024! (My job search experience is shared in my blog [here](/blog/job-search/).)
